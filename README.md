# chatgpt-positive-thought-generator

The code uses the OpenAI API to generate a positive thought using the ChatGPT model. The generate_positive_thought function takes a system message and a user prompt as input, and returns a positive thought generated by the model.

The system message is set to "You are an expert in generating positive thoughts," and the user prompt is set to "I am grateful for the little things in life that bring me joy and happiness. Tell me a positive thought."

The function makes a call to the OpenAI API using the openai.ChatCompletion.create method, passing the model name, messages, max_tokens, and temperature as parameters. The response from the API call is then processed, and the generated positive thought is extracted from the response.

Finally, the positive thought is printed to the console.
